function fmriquality(vols,volsize,figuredir,seed,numrandom,knobs,inplaneextra)

% function fmriquality(vols,volsize,figuredir,seed,numrandom,knobs,inplaneextra)
%
% <vols> is a 4D volume (X x Y x Z x T) or a cell vector of 4D volumes.
%   these volumes should be suitable for interpretation as double
%   (though they do not need to be passed in as double).  the 
%   first three dimensions must be consistent across cases.
% <volsize> is a 3-element vector with the voxel size in mm.
%   the first two voxel dimensions must be the same size.
% <figuredir> is the directory to write figures to.
% <seed> (optional) is the rand state to use.  default: 0.
% <numrandom> (optional) is the number of volumes to randomly select.  default: 100.
% <knobs> (optional) is [A B C D E] with various constants used in
%   the analysis.  see below for details.  default: [99 1/4 1/10 5 10].
% <inplaneextra> (optional) is {A B} where A is [R C] with the matrix size
%   of the in-plane volume and B is [Rsz Csz] with the corresponding voxel
%   sizes in mm.  if this input is supplied, we write out an additional figure
%   (see below).
%
% write out a number of figures that illustrate the spatial quality of the
% fMRI volumes in <vols>.  if you have matlabpool on, we take advantage of parfor.
% note that there is some overlap of this function with homogenizevolumes.m.
%
% here are the details:
% - meanvol.png is the mean across all volumes.  the range is contrast-normalized.
% - meanvolMATCH.png is the mean across all volumes, matched to the in-plane resolution and
%   field-of-view using cubic interpolation.  this is written only if <inplaneextra> 
%   is supplied.  the range is contrast-normalized.
% - HIGH refers to the 99th (i.e. Ath) percentile of the mean volume.
% - brainmask.png is voxels we deem to be "brain".  this is determined by selecting
%   voxels in the mean volume that are at least 1/4 (i.e. B) of HIGH.
% - stdvol.png is the standard deviation across all volumes.  the range is [0 1/10*HIGH]
%   (i.e. [0 C*HIGH]).
% - stdvolhist.png has a histogram of the standard deviation volume.
% - randomvolumes/image%04d.png are <numrandom> randomly selected volumes.  the same range
%   is used for all volumes.  (if there are less than <numrandom> volumes, we just take
%   as many volumes as there are; the order will nevertheless be random.)
% - contours_all.png has the half-height contour for all slices.  we superimpose
%   the results for the <numrandom> randomly selected volumes on the same figure.
% - contours_slice%02d.png has the half-height contour for individual slices.  we
%   superimpose results for the <numrandom> randomly selected volumes on the same figure. 
% 
% details on contour determination:
% - before determining contours, we homogenize each volume by fitting a 3D polynomial
%   of degree up to 5 (i.e. D) to the "brain" voxels and then dividing the whole volume by 
%   the fitted polynomial.  to ensure reasonable results, before the division the
%   fitted polynomial is massaged such that any negative values are set to Inf (so that
%   they result in 0 after division) and values are truncated at 1/10 (i.e. 1/E) of the 
%   maximum value in the fitted polynomial (so that the maximum scaling to be applied is 
%   10 (i.e. E)).
% - after polynomial division, we proceed to the contour calculation.  first,
%   NaN values are set to 0.  then, we calculate the contour at a level of 0.5.
%   then, we render the image.  finally, we repeat the process for each volume, and 
%   then average the rendered images.  we display the average rendered image using a 
%   hot colormap.  pixels that are pure white indicate that the contours from all
%   volumes coincided at those pixels.  when misregistration exists, it will show
%   up as something like blurry, fat borders that are dark red.

% history:
% 2011/07/28 - calculate stdvol using processchunks to save memory
% 2011/07/28 - to save memory, calculate stdvol using only single precision
% 2011/04/17 - implement <inplaneextra>
% 2011/03/26 - change default to [99 1/4 1/10 5 10]

% example:
% vols = getsamplebrain(4);
% fmriquality(vols,[2.5 2.5 2.5],'test');

% MAYBE TODO:
% * draw a line, show me the spread in intersections.
% *Êtake the contour images and calculate MI?  somehow quantify
% * and maybe save contours for later.?
% * what about MI metric compared to inplane
% what about temporal SNR?
